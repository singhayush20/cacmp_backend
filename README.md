# Running this application

This application is using cloudinary as a storage service. Since, the credentials must not be pushed to repository, they are set using environment variables.  
The credentials are picked up by the ```CloudinaryConfigurationProperties``` from the environment variables in production and, from ```secrets.properties``` in development environment.  
Provide following cloudinary properties-  
* cloudinary.api-key
* cloudinary.api-secret
* cloudinary.cloud-name


# Basic idea behind the project

Whenever a user has a complaint regarding any anemity, they can log a query with photo, text and location. Now, each city administration can have a dashboard to view the complaints which appear every day and manage them using the dashboard.

## Some possible features of the platform

1. **Interactive Mapping Integration:** Integrate a map interface (such as Google Maps or Leaflet) where users can pinpoint the location of their complaints visually. City administrators can then have a spatial overview of complaints, facilitating better resource allocation and decision-making.

2. **Real-time Chat Support:** Implement a real-time chat feature where users can interact with customer support representatives or city administrators directly to address urgent issues or seek clarification on their complaints.

3. **AI-Powered Image Recognition:** Utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to automatically analyze uploaded images and categorize complaints based on their content. This can streamline the complaint management process by reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.

4. **Feedback and Rating System:** Allow users to provide feedback and ratings for the resolution of their complaints. This feature can help in assessing the effectiveness of city administration responses and improving service quality over time.

5. **Community Engagement Features:** Incorporate features that encourage community participation and collaboration, such as forums, discussion boards, or polls where residents can discuss local issues, suggest improvements, or vote on priority areas for action.

6. **Gamification Elements:** Introduce gamification elements such as badges, rewards, or leaderboards to incentivize user engagement and participation in submitting complaints or providing feedback.

7. **Multilingual Support:** Provide multilingual support to accommodate diverse language preferences within the community. This can enhance accessibility and inclusivity, especially in multicultural or multilingual cities.

8. **Data Visualization and Analytics:** Offer interactive data visualization tools and dashboards for city administrators to analyze complaint trends, identify hotspots, and make data-driven decisions for resource allocation and urban planning.

9. **Emergency Alert System:** Implement an emergency alert system to notify residents about critical issues, such as natural disasters, road closures, or public health emergencies, and provide instructions on necessary actions to take.

10. **Integration with Social Media Platforms:** Allow users to log in or share their complaints via social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook. Additionally, integrate social media monitoring tools to capture and address complaints posted on these platforms in real-time.

11. **Sustainability and Green Initiatives Tracking:** Include features to track sustainability-related complaints and initiatives, such as waste management, recycling programs, or environmental conservation efforts, demonstrating the city administration's commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship.

12. **Accessibility Features:** Ensure the platform is accessible to users with disabilities by incorporating features such as screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and text resizing options to accommodate diverse accessibility needs.

## Some innovative features (proposed)

Adding innovative technological components to your project can enhance its functionality, usability, and scalability. Here are some ideas to incorporate innovative technologies into your municipal complaint management system:

1. **Machine Learning for Complaint Categorization**: Implement machine learning algorithms to automatically categorize complaints based on their content. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be used to analyze the text of complaints and classify them into relevant categories, improving the efficiency of complaint handling and routing.

2. **Augmented Reality (AR) for Location Reporting**: Integrate AR technology into your mobile app to allow users to report issues with precise location data. Users can use their smartphone cameras to capture real-time images of the problem area, overlaying it with location markers and annotations for accurate reporting.

3. **Blockchain for Transparency and Accountability**: Utilize blockchain technology to create an immutable and transparent record of complaints, resolutions, and feedback. This ensures data integrity, enhances accountability, and builds trust among stakeholders by providing a verifiable audit trail of actions taken by the city administration.

4. **Internet of Things (IoT) Sensors for Environmental Monitoring**: Deploy IoT sensors throughout the city to monitor environmental factors such as air quality, noise levels, and temperature. Integrate sensor data with your complaint management system to correlate citizen complaints with environmental conditions and prioritize interventions accordingly.

5. **Chatbots for Customer Support**: Implement AI-powered chatbots to provide real-time assistance and support to users submitting complaints. Chatbots can answer frequently asked questions, guide users through the complaint submission process, and provide updates on the status of their complaints, enhancing user experience and reducing administrative workload.

6. **Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation**: Apply predictive analytics algorithms to historical complaint data to forecast future demand for municipal services. By analyzing patterns and trends in complaint submissions, city administrators can optimize resource allocation, anticipate service disruptions, and proactively address emerging issues before they escalate.

7. **Geospatial Analysis for Urban Planning**: Leverage geospatial analysis tools to visualize complaint data on interactive maps and identify spatial patterns and hotspots of service delivery issues. This information can inform urban planning decisions, infrastructure investments, and policy interventions to improve overall city livability and resilience.

8. **Voice Recognition for Complaint Submission**: Integrate voice recognition technology into your complaint management system to enable users to submit complaints using voice commands. This feature enhances accessibility for users with disabilities and simplifies the complaint submission process, especially in situations where typing may be cumbersome or impractical.

9. **Gamification for Citizen Engagement**: Gamify the complaint submission process by awarding points, badges, or rewards to users who actively participate in reporting and resolving issues. Leaderboards, challenges, and competitions can incentivize citizen engagement, foster community collaboration, and promote a sense of civic pride.

10. **Virtual Reality (VR) Visualization for Public Consultations**: Use VR technology to create immersive virtual environments for public consultations and community engagement events. Residents can explore proposed urban development projects, infrastructure plans, and policy initiatives in a realistic and interactive manner, providing valuable feedback to city authorities.

By incorporating these innovative technological components into your municipal complaint management system, you can create a more dynamic, responsive, and citizen-centric platform that addresses the evolving needs of urban communities and promotes sustainable urban development.
